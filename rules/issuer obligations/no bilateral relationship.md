### Rule Overview
To support interoperability, scalability, and singleness of money, this rule affirms that Issuers participating in the Ubyx clearing system are not required to maintain direct, bilateral relationships with Receiving Institutions or the holders of stablecoins submitted for redemption. The clearing system serves as the mutualized layer that enables redemptions without bespoke onboarding between parties.

### Obligations
1. **Obligation 1: No Direct Client Relationship Required**
   - Issuers shall process redemption instructions received via the Ubyx Platform without requiring a direct contractual or client relationship with:
     - the Receiving Institution acting as presenter, or
     - the holder or prior transferee of the stablecoin.

2. **Obligation 2: Reliance on Ubyx Infrastructure and Warranties**
   - Issuers may rely on the structure of the Ubyx clearing system, which:
     - authenticates presentment messages,
     - enforces Travel Rule compliance by the Receiving Institution, and
     - provides encoded warranties.
   - The Receiving Institution assumes responsibility for compliance, KYC, and source-of-funds verification with respect to its customer.

3. **Obligation 3: No KYC Requirement on Token Holder**
   - The Issuer is not expected to perform KYC or due diligence on the token holder or beneficiary of the redemption beyond what is provided in the structured presentment message, unless required under applicable law in extraordinary circumstances (e.g. suspicious activity or specific regulatory triggers).
