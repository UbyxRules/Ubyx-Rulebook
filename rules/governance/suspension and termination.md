### Rule Overview
This rule governs the circumstances under which a Participant may be suspended or terminated from the Ubyx clearing system, either temporarily or permanently. It protects the integrity, stability, and reputation of the network by ensuring that systemically risky, persistently non-compliant, or insolvent Participants can be managed in a transparent and legally robust manner.

### Obligations

1. **Obligation 1: Grounds for Suspension**
   - Ubyx Inc. may suspend a Participant where:
     - The Participant is in material breach of the Ubyx Rulebook;
     - The Participant is subject to regulatory censure, license withdrawal, or insolvency proceedings;
     - The Participant fails to maintain required prefunding or platform integration;
     - There is reasonable cause to believe the Participant poses systemic risk or reputational harm to the network.

2. **Obligation 2: Emergency Suspension**
   - In urgent cases, Ubyx Inc. may impose an immediate suspension without prior notice where:
     - There is evidence of fraud, data compromise, or malicious behavior;
     - A Participant has submitted redemptions that would compromise system integrity;
     - A regulator, law enforcement agency, or court mandates immediate action.

3. **Obligation 3: Notice and Procedure**
   - Outside of emergency cases, the Participant shall be given:
     - Written notice of the proposed suspension or termination;
     - At least five (5) Business Days to respond and remediate;
     - A right to request an appeal.
   - Ubyx shall publish the effective date of suspension and any limitations on access.

4. **Obligation 4: Termination**
   - Termination may occur if:
     - The Participant fails to cure a suspension breach within the designated cure period;
     - The Participant voluntarily withdraws
     - The Participant’s license, charter, or regulatory status is revoked with no path to reinstatement.
   - Upon termination:
     - All outstanding obligations (e.g., redemptions, dispute responses, data retention) must be fulfilled;
     - Access to the Ubyx Platform shall be revoked;
     - The Participant shall be removed from the active directory of clearing members.

5. **Obligation 5: Coordination with Settlement Agent**
   - In all suspensions and terminations, Ubyx shall coordinate with the Settlement Agent to:
     - Freeze prefunded fiat balances if applicable;
     - Cancel pending redemptions not yet settled;
     - Return stablecoins to Receiving Institutions if redemption cannot be completed.

### Non-Compliance Penalties
Non-compliance with this rule may result in:
- Immediate loss of clearing privileges;
- Referral to the Participant’s regulator or supervisory authority;
- Listing on Ubyx’s compliance bulletin for all network Participants;
- Legal claims for damages incurred by other Participants or Ubyx as a result of non-cooperation.
