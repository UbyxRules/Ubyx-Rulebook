### Rule Overview
This rule provides a clear and structured mechanism for Participants to challenge decisions made by Ubyx Inc. or the Ubyx Association, and to resolve disputes with other Participants. It ensures procedural fairness, promotes transparency, and reduces reliance on litigation or regulatory escalation.

### Obligations

1. **Obligation 1: Right to Appeal**
   - A Participant may appeal a decision made by Ubyx Inc. or the Ubyx including but not limited to:
     - Suspension or termination notices;
     - Rejection of redemption instructions;
     - Disputes regarding compliance enforcement, penalties, or audit outcomes;
     - Refusal of admission, re-entry, or certification.

2. **Obligation 2: Appeal Submission and Timelines**
   - An appeal must be submitted in writing within ten (10) Business Days of the original decision.
   - The appeal must include:
     - A clear description of the contested decision;
     - Grounds for the appeal and supporting evidence;
     - The remedy or outcome sought by the Participant.

3. **Obligation 3: Formation of Appeal Panel**
   - Upon receipt of a valid appeal, Ubyx shall convene an independent Appeal Panel within five (5) Business Days. The panel shall comprise:
     - One representative of the Ubyx Compliance Committee;

   - Decisions may:
     - Uphold, modify, or reverse the original action;
     - Prescribe remedial conditions or timeframes;
     - Be final and binding unless overruled by regulatory intervention or mutual agreement.

5. **Obligation 5: Inter-Participant Dispute Resolution**
   - In the event of a dispute between two or more Participants:
     - The parties must first attempt to resolve the matter bilaterally in good faith within five (5) Business Days;
     - Failing resolution, either party may escalate the matter to Ubyx for neutral mediation;
     - If mediation fails, the matter may be referred to an Appeal Panel under the process above.

6. **Obligation 6: Regulatory and Legal Oversight**
   - Nothing in this rule limits the right of a Participant to:
     - Refer a matter to a competent regulator or court;
     - Seek injunctive relief in the event of urgent or irreparable harm;
     - Comply with obligations under applicable law.

### Non-Compliance Penalties
Failure to participate in good faith in an appeal or dispute resolution process may result in:
- Adverse inference in the resolution of the appeal;
- Regulatory reporting by Ubyx of a Participant's failure to cooperate;
- Delay or rejection of reinstatement requests;
- Increased scrutiny or audit in future compliance assessments.
