### Rule Overview
Participants may choose to withdraw from the Ubyx clearing system for commercial, strategic, or regulatory reasons. This rule outlines the required notice, operational offboarding procedures, and post-withdrawal obligations to ensure a smooth and non-disruptive exit. 

### Obligations

1. **Obligation 1: Advance Notice Requirement**
   - A Participant intending to withdraw must submit written notice to Ubyx Inc. at least 30 calendar days before the intended withdrawal date.
   - The notice must specify:
     - Intended date of withdrawal;
     - A point of contact for offboarding coordination;
     - A statement affirming that all obligations under the Rulebook will be honored through the effective date.

2. **Obligation 2: Settlement Continuity Until Withdrawal**
   - Until the withdrawal date:
     - The Participant must continue to fulfill all obligations under the Ubyx Rulebook, including redemption, compliance, dispute handling, and prefunding;
     - The Participant shall not be excused from participation in settlement or messaging functions unless Ubyx Inc. expressly waives those requirements in writing.

3. **Obligation 3: Pending Transactions and Wind-Down**
   - Prior to withdrawal, the Participant must:
     - Ensure all redemptions, claims, or chargebacks in progress are resolved;
     - Withdraw or reassign any outstanding prefunded fiat balances held by the Settlement Agent;
     - Remove Ubyx-specific wallet connections from active production systems;
     - Cooperate with any reasonable Ubyx Platform data reconciliation request.

4. **Obligation 4: Legal and Audit Retention**
   - After withdrawal:
     - The former Participant remains subject to legal and regulatory obligations associated with data retention, dispute resolution, and audit requests for a minimum of 5 years;
     - Ubyx may retain Travel Rule and transaction metadata involving the former Participant as required by law or compliance policy.

5. **Obligation 5: Re-entry After Withdrawal**
   - A withdrawn Participant must re-apply through the standard onboarding process if seeking to rejoin the Ubyx clearing system. Ubyx reserves the right to require an independent compliance and technical readiness assessment before reinstatement.

### Non-Compliance Penalties
Non-compliance with the withdrawal procedure may result in:
- Refusal to honor late-stage redemptions or message submissions;
- Legal claims for operational disruption;
- Referral to relevant regulators for breach of systemic withdrawal obligations;
- Denial of future re-entry until remediation is complete.
