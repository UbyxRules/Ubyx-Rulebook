### Rule Overview
This rule defines the moment of final settlement in the Ubyx stablecoin clearing process. Finality is critical for the enforceability of redemptions and the system’s legal and accounting integrity. It ensures that once fiat funds have moved between prefunded accounts at the instruction of the Issuer, the transaction is irreversible, unconditional, and binding on all parties.

### Obligations
1. **Obligation 1: Issuer Instruction**
   - The Issuer shall instruct the Settlement Agent, via the Ubyx Platform, to move fiat currency from its prefunded cash account to the Receiving Institution’s cash account once it has approved the redemption.

2. **Obligation 2: Finality on Settlement Execution**
   - A redemption shall be deemed final when the Settlement Agent executes the fiat transfer between prefunded accounts and submits authenticated confirmation of this execution to the Ubyx Platform.

3. **Obligation 3: Logging and Timestamping**
   - The Ubyx Platform shall log and timestamp the finality of settlement in a tamper-evident ledger that is auditable.

### Non-Compliance Penalties
